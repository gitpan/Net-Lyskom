2003-10-22: Version 1.1 released. Contains fixes for all three
	    reported bugs in v1.0. They are:

	    * Test number five would fail when run in a different
	      timezone than the Lysator Lyskom server lives in.

	    * It was impossible to create a Net::Lyskom::Time object
	      and set any part of the time to the value 0, since the
	      object stupidly checked for non-truth rather than
	      definedness when deciding if it should use a default.

	    * The number of the bcc_recpt miscinfo type was wrong.
	      This was a pretty serious bug, since it'd make
	      communication with the server fail on all texts with
	      that kind of miscinfo.
